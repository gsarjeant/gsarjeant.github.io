# Let's see what happens now

I don't know what's up with the post timing. Maybe it's going all UTC based on the filename? I guess that's okay for long form blog posts, though it will be a little weird if I'm intermingling blog posts and direct posts. I'm not that big a poster that that's really going to matter. I should figure out how to specify the time zone. though.
