The year: 1995. I: a senior at Northwestern University. Northwestern University: an institution that forgot its football team was supposed to be abysmal. Northwestern University football: 10-1 and going to the Rose Bowl.

I did the only reasonable thing. I asked my girlfriend to shave my head, except for an "N" in the back. She did the only reasonable thing. She shaved an N into my head. Today, she's my wife.

A couple days later, I was walking into my part-time job, and an older couple - who were likely younger than I am now - were walking out. They both gave me a disapproving look before she leaned to him and stage-whispered, "This is this whole new subculture that I've been hearing about."

Had this happened today, I'd have been aghast, but at the time I laughed. I'm a white dude, so she clearly thought I was a skinhead (today we skip the euphemism and call them what they are: neo-nazis). At the time, I thought it was funny for a couple reasons. One: I was (and remain) about as far as you can get from a skinhead. Two: I'd known about skinheads for years. They were hardly new. I felt young and informed.

I coined the term "Subculture of One" in the aftermath as a winking nod to a silly not-quite-encounter. My girlfriend got me "Subculture of One" business cards. It was a good laugh and a great tagline, but I've had a lot of time to think about it since.

How often are we judged by others? How often is that judgment based on misconceptions rooted in the superficial? How often is that judgment wrong? And how fortunate am I, as a middle-aged white dude, to be essentially immune to those misconceptions?

There's a lot wrapped up in the phrase. A fun time of my youth. A place I loved. A silly old/young misunderstanding. But today it mostly reminds me to be thankful for my tailwinds and to be mindful of others' headwinds.

The tale doesn't end there. It $also has an element of the absurd. I tried - and failed - to dye the "N" purple. The circumstances of that failure make a good story of their own. One for another time.
